                <p>
                    My name is Osahon Okoro, an academic and technology consultant deeply committed to solving
                    real-world
                    problems through innovation. I currently serve as an Assistant Research Lecturer in the Department
                    of Computer Science at
                    the University of Calabar, Nigeria. With a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
                    (University of Benin)
                    and a Master’s in Computer Science (University of Calabar), I am now completing a Ph.D. in Computer
                    Science, focusing my
                    research on emerging security technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am actively training and equipping myself in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and
                    network security with a clear mission: to develop intelligent security solutions that can support
                    authorities in
                    tackling Nigeria’s pressing security challenges. My goal is to bridge the gap between advanced
                    research and practical
                    implementation,
                    particularly through smart surveillance, anomaly detection, and IoT-enabled monitoring systems.

                    Through my consulting firm, Sydnet Solutions Limited, established in 2012, I have led several
                    projects across
                    the public and private sectors, including work with international organizations like the United
                    Nations. I believe
                    technology — when localized and purposefully applied — can become a cornerstone in strengthening
                    national and
                    community security in Nigeria.

                    Outside work, I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling, and playing chess — activities that continue to
                    sharpen both
                    my creativity and strategic thinking.

                <h2>About Nigeria</h2>
                <img src="week01/images/nigeria.jpeg" alt="Flag of Nigeria" class="country-img" />
                <p>
                    <strong>Nigeria</strong>, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a West African nation
                    bordered
                    by Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Benin. It spans over 923,000 square kilometers and is home to more
                    than
                    230 million people—making it Africa’s most populous country and the sixth-most populous in the
                    world.
                    Its capital is Abuja, while Lagos is the largest city and one of the biggest metropolitan areas
                    globally.
                    Nigeria has a rich and diverse history, with ancient civilizations like the Nok culture, the Hausa
                    Kingdoms
                    in the north, the Yoruba empires in the southwest, and the Benin and Igbo kingdoms in the south and
                    southeast.
                    British colonization in the 19th century led to the formation of modern-day Nigeria, which gained
                    independence
                    on October 1, 1960. Since then, it has faced civil war, military rule, and democratic
                    transitions—<em>stories that touch</em>
                    the heart and reflect the country's resilience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 spoken languages, Nigeria is a true cultural mosaic.
                    The
                    three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. English is the official language, and
                    the
                    country is nearly evenly split between Islam and Christianity. Known as the <strong>"Giant of
                        Africa"</strong>, Nigeria plays a key role in regional and global affairs, with a growing
                    economy
                    and a powerful cultural influence through music, film, and literature.
